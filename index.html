                <h3>The Genius of Physics</h3>
                <p>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a renowned theoretical physicist of German origin who made profound contributions to physics
                     and is widely regarded 
                    as one of the greatest scientists in history.He developed the theory 
                        of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and energy. Einstein 
                        received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, which contributed significantly 
                        to the foundation of quantum theory.</p>
