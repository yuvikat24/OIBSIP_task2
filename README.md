I have made a tribute page as part of second project at oasis infobyte internship.This tribute page project utilizes HTML and CSS to honor a chosen individual by showcasing their life and acievements. Through structured layout and design elements such as headers, images, quotes, and sections highlighting key accomplishments, the page aims to provide a visually appealing and informative tribute. By employing responsive design principles, it ensures accessibility across different devices while maintaining a cohesive aesthetic. The project not only celebrates the subject's legacy but also demonstrates foundational skills in web development, including styling, layout management, and content organization.
